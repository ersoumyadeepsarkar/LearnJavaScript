    <p id="p1">Welcome to the Apna College DOM tutorial!</p>
    <p id="p2">
      In this tutorial, we will learn about the Document Object Model (DOM),
      which is a programming interface for web documents. The DOM represents the
      structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to
      manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
    </p>
    <h2 id="h2">What is the DOM?</h2>
    <p id="p3">
      The DOM is an application programming interface (API) that provides a
      structured representation of a document, such as an HTML or XML file. It
      allows scripts to update the content, structure, and style of a document
      while it is being viewed.
    </p>
    <p class="heading">
      The DOM represents the document as a tree structure, where each node in the
      tree corresponds to a part of the document. For example, an HTML document
      is represented as a tree of elements, attributes, and text nodes.   
    </p>
    <p class="heading">
      The DOM provides methods and properties to access and manipulate these nodes,
      allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
